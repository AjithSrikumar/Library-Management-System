Library-Management-System
=========================

This is a library management application in Java
Tips:

•	This application is works with MySQL database.
•	If you are using a VPN connection during executing the application, there might be some errors.
•	First, run the `Library Management System.jar` and then program asks you to enter your MySQL password to be able to connect it.
•	If program can’t connect to your MySQL successfully, an error message appears.
•	At the first use, you should select admin mode and select a password for yourself.
•	After this step, you should be able go to main page. Here is place that you can manage books and users.
•	You can’t log-in in User mode at first, because there is no user!
•	To be able to log-in in user mode, you should create at least one user in Users section and then use the user ID number in password field to log-in.
•	Note that `pics` folder and two another .jar files should place besides of `Library Management System.jar` file.
•	Admin cannot delete a book that is borrowed, and cannot delete a user that has a borrowed book and not returned yet.

•	I am waiting for your valuable feedbacks.


Thank you.
